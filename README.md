## Email SMTP Service ðŸ“§

This guide explains how to use an email SMTP service to send emails programmatically via an API. The service allows you to send emails using any SMTP-compatible email provider (e.g., Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, or others) by making a POST request with your credentials and email details.

### Concept
The email SMTP service enables you to send emails by providing:
- **Headers:** Your email account username (user, typically your email address) and an SMTP password or app-specific password (password) from your email provider.

- **Body:** The recipient's email address (to), email subject (subject), and email content (template).

You send this data in a JSON payload to the serviceâ€™s API endpoint using a POST request. The service validates the data and sends the email via the specified SMTP server.

### API Request Structure
To send an email, make a POST request to the serviceâ€™s API endpoint (e.g., [https://email-http-sercice.onrender.com/send](https://email-http-sercice.onrender.com/send)). The request must include:
**Headers:**
- user: Your email address (e.g., fariol@mail.ru or yourname@mail.ru).
- password: The SMTP password or app-specific password from your email provider.

**Body (JSON):**
- to: Recipientâ€™s email address (must be valid).
- subject: Email subject.
- template: Email content (plain text or HTML).

### Example: Sending an Email with curl
Hereâ€™s an example of how to send an email using curl:

```bash
curl -X POST https://email-http-sercice.onrender.com/send \
  -H "user: yourname@gmail.com" \
  -H "password: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "to": "blondeau.nbif@gmail.com",
    "subject": "Announcement",
    "template": "Hello Fariol Blondeau the API is working perfeclty"
  }'
```

Happy emailing! ðŸš€
